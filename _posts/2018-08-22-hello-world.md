Following his ban from Snapchat yesterday, the TR.NEWS team set up a Telegram group for Tommy Robinson to once again be able to connect with the people directly.

This comes after Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube all banned Mr Robinson.

Overnight, the new Telegram group has attracted more than 5000 members.

Telegram has a similar structure to WhatsApp but is not owned by Facebook, itâ€™s owned by a Russian pair of businessmen who have shown not to cower to political pressure.

Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram allows groups with no maximum capacity.
